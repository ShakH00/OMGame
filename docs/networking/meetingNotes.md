## Full Team

### Plan a meeting for everyone to get on the same page
- Finalize all planning / stubs and begin implementing code: Divide codebase workload for all team members to get sufficient work done
- Make sure we have a neat timeline that allows us to be done early, so that we have a good amount of time to work on the demo videos
