# **Meeting Notes**
## 2025-03-02
**16:30 - 17:55**
### What has been done
- **Hatem:** Created a draft of API documentation
- **Sultan:** Exploring implementing functional net code in Java
- **Nova:** focus on writing structure/documentation (to be turned into class diagram)
  - Has a functional prototype of a turn based game working with net code
  - Want to make localhost (two players/server on same system) as a minimum
- **Uzair:** Has not done yet, going to work tonight.
### Need to do
- Make it such that game logic does not need to touch net code, using arrays/strings as param./return values
- **We need to make class diagrams**
- **Focus on Iteration 1 deliverables** (Listed in `planning.md`)
- Update GitLab issue board
#### Full Team
- **Discuss overall program file/project structure**
- **Discuss diagram structure/formatting**
- **Discuss Git etiquette** (How branches should be handled, merge conflicts, etc.)
- **Group timeline document**
- **Making use cases???**
### Plans for the week
- **Nova:** Writing docs./planning structure (eventually can make class diagram). Help **Hatem** with diagrams.
- **Hatem:** Making diagrams (structure, and overall network flow/structure). Help **Nova** with docs.
- **Sultan:** Translate current code into an informal diagram (to teach how practical netcode works). Create stubs for input/output (using arrays for data comms.).
- **Uzair:** Diagrams (structure) with **Nova** and **Hatem**, based off the code that **Sultan** made.
