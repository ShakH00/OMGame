### Iteration Deliverable Requirements

## P3

### Integration 

- **Game Logic** Discuss with first, as how to best suit their needs and wrap around their code. We can offer some feedback as to what helps us most.
- **Authentication** Work closely with in a more cohesive manner as to 
- **Leaderboard/Matchmaking**
- **Integration**
- **Website** Nova 

### Primary Goals
- **First develop stubs that work on the client side as a failsafe**, then we can move to a functional + server based system afterwards

- Finalize a fully functional prototype of the networking system.

- Ensure complete documentation to support the system.

- Coordinate with GUI/Game Logic to ensure integration readiness.

- Address all feedback and required changes from P2 critiques.

- Contribute meaningfully to codebase and Git logs.

- Prepare for video demos and individual deliverables.

## Subteam Tasks (Based on Current Division)

### üîπ Hatem + Nova ‚Äî Docs + Planning + Code

#### ‚úÖ Refine all documentation for P3:

- networkingCodeExplanation.md (FINALIZED ‚úÖ)

- apiDocumentation.md (UPDATED ‚úÖ)

- error_handling_ideas.md (UPDATED ‚úÖ with advanced strategies)

- tentative_matchmaking_sessions_ideas.md (EXPERIMENTAL IDEAS ‚úÖ)

#### ‚úÖ Create visual diagrams:

- Error handling flowcharts (mermaid diagrams ‚úÖ)

- Game flow / client-server interaction diagrams ‚úÖ

- Game class diagram

- Use case Diagram

- Finalize meetingNotes.md and planning.md

##### üìå Final check and review of all P3 documents

### üîπ Sultan + Uzair ‚Äî Code + Research

‚úÖ Analyze GameServerT.java, PlayerT.java, PlayerData.java, PlayerDatabase.java

‚úÖ Identify and implement networking stub functions

Incorporate chat feature if feasible (stretch goal)

‚è≥ Begin functional networking implementation based on GUI/game logic feedback
‚è≥ Integrate reconnection logic and move validation (if not already done)

##### üìå Coordinate with documentation team to align terminology and flow

## Group Deliverables (Networking Team Must Contribute To)

### These must be in GitLab and D2L:

- team.md ‚Äî Updated list of members/UCIDs

- README.md ‚Äî Instructions on running + overview of system

- git_log.csv ‚Äî Record of Git commits (everyone must be active!)

- ChangesMade.md ‚Äî Summary of P2 feedback and what was updated (include diagrams if applicable)

##### Documentation Files:

- All updated markdowns (networking)

- Game logic, diagrams, API, and flow breakdowns

- gitlab_link.txt

### Video Demos

#### Product Showcase (Group Video) ‚Äî ~12 min

- Networking must be shown working end-to-end:

- Real-time interaction

- Handling of turns

- Reconnection behavior

- (Optional: Chat functionality)

### Tech Demo (Individual) ‚Äî ~10 min

#### Each member must:

- Show their code contribution

- Explain their design logic

- Reflect on testing + future improvements

## Individual Deliverables (P3)

### Each member must submit to D2L:

- [UCID]\_worklog_p3.xlsx

- [UCID]\_peer_evaluations_p3.xlsx

- [UCID]\_reflection_p3.pdf

- [UCID]\_tech_demo_pNN.mp4 + timestamp file

- AI disclosure (if applicable)

### Stubbed Components Required (per professor's note)

#### Even if full implementation is not possible:

- Add stub methods for:

- Database connections

- Server hosting

- Chat feature

- Matchmaking integration
