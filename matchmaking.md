1. How Close Should Players Be in Elo?
- Default range: ±100 Elo for instance a 1200-rated player is matched with 1100–1300 Elo players.
- Beginner-friendly adjustments: If a player is new (Elo < 1000), the system can initially match them more flexibly like with ±150).

2. Should Matchmaking Thresholds Expand Over Time?
- Yes to reduce wait time I think we do need to increase the range
  - After 30 seconds: Expand range by ±50 Elo.
  - After 1 minute: Expand by another ±50 Elo (total ±200).
  - After 2 minutes: Match with the closest available player.

3. How Should a Match Affect a Player’s Elo?
- My initial thoughts: f a lower-rated player wins, they gain more Elo than if a higher-rated player wins. Conversely, a higher-rated player loses more Elo if they lose to a weaker opponent.
